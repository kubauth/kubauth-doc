This is a technical documentation about an OIDC server named Kubauth.
Built with mkdocs with some extension.
It has been written in poor globish by a French native.
Could you rewrite 20-installation.md in correct technical english.
Don't touch the remaining of the manuel for now.

Now, rewrite index.md

Now, rewrite all files in 30-user-guide folder

Now, rewrite all files in 40-applications-integration folder

Now, rewrite all files in 50-kubernetes-integration folder

Now, rewrite all files in 70-appendix folder
