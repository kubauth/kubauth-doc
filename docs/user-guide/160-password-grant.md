# Password Grant (ROPC)

OAuth’s Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) grant type, aka the password grant, was included in the original OAuth 2.0 specification as a temporary measure back in 2012. 
It was designed as a quick way of migrating old applications from legacy authentication mechanisms, such as HTTP Basic Authentication or credential sharing, 
and onto an OAuth tokenized architecture.
